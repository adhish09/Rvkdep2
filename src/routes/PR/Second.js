              Prem Rawat is always exploring new and innovative ways to
              communicate his message of peace and self-discovery. He has
              created a free online course called Peace Education and Knowledge
              (PEAK), which is available to anyone on his media platform,
              Timeless Today. Another way he spreads his message is through his
              Peace Education Program (PEP), which has been well-received in a
              variety of institutions such as prisons, schools, police
              academies, hospitals, nursing homes, hospices, and veterans
              centers in more than 80 countries.
